# Optical-Flow-based-Obstacle-Avoidance

Uses Optical flow to avoid obstacle and is based on this paper http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.5772/5715. 
This implementation has been tested for a simulated robot in Unity3d but can be used with any modaility.
Requires Opencv3 and ROS Kinetic.

 Update: 2020-07-30
- After a gap of two years I have decided to refine and polish this project. 
- I will be working on development of a proper qt based GUI to allow controlling different paramaters
- Porting it to ROS melodic and OpenCV version 4
- Possible porting to ROS2 as well
- Implement heuristic based optical avoidance
